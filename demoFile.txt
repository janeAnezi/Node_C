# **** NodeJs Events ***
Objects in Node.js can fire events, like readStream objects fires events when opening and closing a file

var fs = require('fs');
var rs = fs.createReadStream('./demofile.txt');
rs.on('open', function () {
  console.log('The file is open');
});

*** Events Module ****
Nodejs has built-in  module called Events, where you can create, fire, and listen for your own events

To include the built-in events use require() method and to be able to access these properties and methods, create an EventEmitter object.

var events = require('events');
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();

*** You can assign event handlers to your own events with the EventEmitter object.
